<h3>$Covindia</h3>
            <p>
      Covindia was a web application created as an emergency resource during the 2020 Covid Pandemic in India as a database for available emergency resources (hospital beds, oxygen tanks, ventilators, medications, etc.) for cities across India. In a 2 months run time the app served over 30,000 queries for desperately needed medical supplies.
