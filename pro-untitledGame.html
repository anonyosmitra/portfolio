<h3>$strategyGame</h3>
            <p>
                This is a 2D multiplayer strategy game currently in development. It is something I call the modern version of chess. It is based on war strategy games like [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)" target="_blank">Risk</a>] with more realistic resource management, industry and trade planning. </p><p>Note:This game is still it early stages and not ready for publishing.
            </p>

<p>Status: Development</p>
